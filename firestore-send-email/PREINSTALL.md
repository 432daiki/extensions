Use this extension to render and send emails that contain the information from documents added to a specified Cloud Firestore collection.

Adding a document triggers this extension to send an email built from the document's fields. The document's top-level fields specify the email sender and recipients, including `to`, `cc`, and `bcc` options (each supporting UIDs). The document's `message` field specifies the other email elements, like subject line and email body (either plaintext or HTML)

Here's a basic example document write that would trigger this extension:

```js
admin.firestore().collection('mail').add({
  to: 'someone@example.com',
  message: {
    subject: 'Hello from Firebase!',
    html: 'This is an <code>HTML</code> email body.',
  },
})
```

You can also optionally configure this extension to render emails using [Handlebar](https://handlebarsjs.com/) templates. Each template is a document stored in a Cloud Firestore collection.

When you configure this extension, you'll need to supply your **SMTP credentials for mail delivery**. Note that this extension is for use with bulk email service providers, like SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.

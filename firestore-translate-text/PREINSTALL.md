Use this extension to translate strings (for example, text messages) written to a Cloud Firestore collection.

This extension listens to your specified Cloud Firestore collection. If you add a string to a specified field in any document within that collection, this extension:

- Translates the string into your specified target language(s); the source language of the string is automatically detected.
- Adds the translation(s) of the string to a separate specified field in the same document.

You specify the desired target languages using ISO-639-1 codes. You can find a list of valid languages and their corresponding codes in the [Cloud Translation API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/languages).

If the original non-translated field of the document is updated, then the translations will be automatically updated, as well.

#### Additional setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you've [set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.
